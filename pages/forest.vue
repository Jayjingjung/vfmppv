                        Even though large parts of Lao PDR are still covered with forest today, the quality of the
                        forest
                        has deteriorated significantly. Despite GOL efforts to sustainably manage forest resources, the
                        country has undergone significant deforestation. 70% of Lao PDR was under forest cover 60 years
                        ago.
                        Since then, deforestation has averaged about 0.3% of the country’s land area each year, with
                        over-logging, shifting cultivation, land concessions, mining and hydropower among the chief
                        contributing factors driven by population growth and general economic development.</span>

                        In line with the Eighth National Social and Economic Development Plan (2016-2020), Lao-German
                        bilateral development cooperation focuses on two priority areas: (i) rural development in poor
                        regions of Lao PDR, and (ii) sustainable economic development. The stated goal of the first
                        priority area is that “socio-economic living conditions of poor rural households are improved
                        through sustainable management of natural resources”. Under this program goal, the German
                        Government through the Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) agreed to support
                        the Government of Lao PDR (GOL) in the development of village forestry (VF) management systems.
                        The project is intended to encompass (i) forest conservation and sustainable management, and
                        (ii) improved livelihoods for rural communities.</span>

                        VF initiatives in Lao PDR began in the early 1990s with the establishment of a village forestry
                        unit in the Department of Forestry (DoF). The Forest Law of 1996 encouraged participatory
                        forestry by allowing the allocation of land to villagers for sustainable forest management,
                        which led to the development of a national village forestry strategy in 1997. In the following
                        years, village forestry models have slowly evolved, culminating most recently in the SUFORD
                        Project which operates in Production Forest Areas. Despite these efforts, convincing models are
                        yet to be developed.

                        A number of key elements are generally accepted as part of the VF approach, including: (i) local
                        management of village forests, (ii) community participation, (iii) devolved decision-making, and
                        (iv) direct (such as income generation from timber and NTFPs) and indirect (such as increased
                        capacity and enhanced environmental services) benefit flows to the local populations involved.
                        In addition, it is generally understood and now integrated to the revised Forest Law (2019) that
                        village forestry involves the management of forest and forestland within the village
                        jurisdiction. These elements are embodied in the Common Approach to VF developed by DoF and will
                        guide VFMP implementation.

                        The Village Forestry Management Project (VFMP) is funded by the German Ministry of Economic
                        Cooperation and Development (BMZ) through KfW. It will be supported by KfW from mid-2019 to May
                        2026, with a budget of 7 million Euro, with an additional in kind contribution from the
                        counterpart side, equal to around 10% of the overall project value. The Project Executing Agency
                        is the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF), with the Department of Forestry (DoF) acting
                        as the Implementing Agency.
